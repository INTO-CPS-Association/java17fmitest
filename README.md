# java17fmitest

This project investigates the new Java 17 Foreign incubator project.
The Java 17 [foreign incubator project](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/jdk.incubator.foreign/jdk/incubator/foreign/package-summary.html) allows the developer to represent the native interface directly in Java, without requiring a `Java Native Interface` approach.

Remember to add `--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED,jdk.incubator` to VM options.
